                            this period other than the fact that my mom would never let me

                            about it. However my anger quickly faded away as I joined my
                            school's theater program and became somewhat of a theater kid.
                            This also marks the beginning of me genuinely enjoying learning
                            as I blossomed as the nerd I was meant to be.

                            dance. Drill team ended up being my life for the next three years,
                            and I am still bestfriends with the girls I met on Royales (the 
                            Plano West Drill Team). When COVID hit and we we're all quarentine
                            I got into working out, and when quarentine was lifted I started
                            working as a waitress at a family owned italian restaurant called 
                            Florentina's Italian Bistro.
